title: I’m a Frontend Happiness Engineer
---
It so happened that I stumbled upon [Buffer’s open salaries initiative](https://open.buffer.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/). The thing that popped to my eye more than their exposing a salary formula (albeit [much criticised](https://medium.com/@gatesvp/how-buffer-cheats-on-open-salaries-7f333fe231f2#.w89tra1mw)), is the fact that they have a position for Happiness Leader. And not only that — they have happiness heros as well. I set out to check what happiness leaders and heros do. Maybe I could be a happiness something too. I was somewhat disappointed to find out that it’s just [their terminology for Customer Success](https://buffer.com/journey/happiness-hero). Of course, it very cool that a company names happiness as the title of their CS positions. Not only cool, it also reflects well the values that they’re trying to pass. But still I had a totally different association with the word happiness.

It struck me immediately. Happiness! Of course! it’s the most important thing, it’s the essence of being. It’s where it all starts. Or should. And I realized I could have happiness in my title as well.

When you’re developing, happiness is a great deal. And I don’t mean cheerful or smiley. People who work with me can attest that I’m not always perky. But I always try to instill happiness in my code and work. Happy code is code that other developer are happy to read (yep, that’s a formal definition right there). If you’re developing for happiness, most chances that you’re writing code that is both clear and functions well. The actual system you’re writing is happy. And guess what? You’re probably thinking about the **user** being happy as well.

I don’t even need to add **senior** to my title. Because if I’m successful in being a happiness engineer, I’m probably writing good API’s, consulting a lot with my colleagues, creating a maintenance heaven, and keeping bugs to a minimum.

That’s it, then. I’m a Frontend Happiness Engineer.
