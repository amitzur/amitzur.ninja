I’ve just stumbled upon the [hashtag](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=%23findyourtribe&em=1) [#findyourtribe](https://twitter.com/hashtag/findyourtribe). People in the proper state of mind are basically telling you to always find people around you who make you feel awesome.

I find this so true. In every activity of my life I find that it’s impossible to move anywhere without being cheered on by a colleague, wife or even an offspring. Support is crucial, and the lack of it is parallising. This sounds trivial, but it’s often overlooked. Many great leaders are portrayed as loners who believed in something and made it happen. While this might be true in essence, I think it’s a romanization of reality. No one can lead to any significant change without chewing on discussions, hearing opinions and feeling supported.

At this point I realized why I’m having so much fun at my workplace. I’m a software developer at [Capriza](http://capriza.com). I come to work every day and find myself writing code that helps people work at work. I waltz into endless spontaneous and passionate discussions about architecture, design, code, technology and user experience. Sometimes walking in that open space feels like I’m in a stock broker company because of all the noise and verve. Only instead of people running for that day’s money, they’re being motivated by simply doing what they are passionate about. I have found my tribe. It’s a cool tribe. Everyone is a north star, and everyone has something to teach. Be it discussions about the current state of affairs in web technology, the absurdities we are facing as developers and framework religion wars, or exciting optimizations and paradigm shifts. [There is a potential spark at every corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUgs2O7Okqc&feature=youtu.be&t=47). We stand together in the mission of using the web to do something exciting. We’re shaping the high water mark.

It so happens that every one has their own personal motivation. But there’s a common ground for fulfilling that motivation — and that’s finding the people who will help you accomplish your mission. That’s your tribe.
